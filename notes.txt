- P3 = data bus (DB0 to DB7)
- P2.0 = E
- P2.2 = R/W
- P2.3 = RS
- RS:
	0 = instruction register
	1 = data register
- R/W:
	0 = write
	1 = read
- E: set to 1 to start data read/write

TODO:
- query CPU frequency for # cycles needed for certain delay times

Possible improvements:
- use MSP430 voltage monitoring functionality to check if we need to manually reset LCD
    - or should we just manually reset always
